    "You have been given a dataset and tasked with trying to solve a problem. In WW2, **expensive fighter planes were going down quite frequently due to bullet fire**. The military decided to conduct an analysis and surveyed all the surviving planes in an effort to catalogue which regions of the plane should be reinforced. \n",
    "\n",
    "With limited resources, the military could only reinforce a maximum of two zones. Your task is to look at the bullet data for the planes and help determine which areas of the plane should be reinforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given a schematic of the plane, and told that the workers added a grid to the schematic, divided it up into regions A,B,C,D,E and recorded a value of 1 wherever there was a bullet hole across all the planes that returned. Areas without bullet holes are marked as 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "They gave you a csv file with this information called `bullet_data.csv`. Yes, these WW2 workers are very sophisticated and had access to a computer :-).\n",
