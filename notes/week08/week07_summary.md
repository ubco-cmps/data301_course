=======================

Hello!

Welcome to Week 8 - this week we will be learning about some advanced analysis, finishing up the section on creating effective data visualizations, and getting some more practice with git and version control.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week08_task1" class="box"> Review feedback you received, reflect on it, and make corrections to your repo if needed. </input></label>

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week08_task2" class="box"> Attend the [Classes](classes.md) this week </input></label>


<label><input type="checkbox" id="week08_task3" class="box"> Attend the **[lab](./lab/README.md)** this week</input></label>

```{tip}
The labs will be organized as semi-structured help sessions.
The TA will usually explain the key components of the lab for the first 15 minutes.
We will then take attendance mostly for tracking purposes, but attendance is not mandatory and you will not lose marks for not attending the lab.
If we see that you're missing labs and not performing well in the course, we may reach out to you about the missed lab attendance.
You are welcome to attend additional labs or Student Hours in the course if you need extra help.
