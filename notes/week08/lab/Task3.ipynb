    "Method chaining allows you to apply multiple processing steps to your dataframe in a fewer lines of code so it is more readable. You should avoid having too many methods in your chain, as the more you have in a single chain, the harder it is to debug or troubleshoot. I would target about 5 methods in a chain, though this is a flexible suggestion and you should do what makes your analysis the most readable and group your chains based on their purpose (e.g., loading/cleaning, processing, etc…).\n"
