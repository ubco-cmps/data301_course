This lab has has four tasks.
Complete each task in the appropriate `.ipynb` file, these are the only files that will be graded for this lab.

## Submission Instructions

Once you are done with his lab, you will need to submit your repository for grading on Gradescope.

NOTE: If you make any changes to your GitHub repository, you MUST re-submit on Gradescope to make sure we grade the latest version of your repository. You may submit on Gradescope as many times as you like.

I have recorded a video with some instructions on how to submit your lab on Gradescope:
