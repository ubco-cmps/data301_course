# Lab 10: Excel - Analyzing and Reporting Data

In this Lab, we will shift gears a bit and you will be working with Microsoft Excel to practice your data analysis skills.

## Submission Instructions

Once you are done with his lab, **you will need to submit your repository for grading on Gradescope**.

**NOTE: If you make any changes to your GitHub repository, you MUST re-submit on Gradescope to make sure we grade the latest version of your repository. You may submit on Gradescope as many times as you like.**

I have recorded a video with some instructions on how to submit your lab on Gradescope:

1. Before you can start submitting work, you may see a dialog box telling you that your assignment will be timed. Read the information carefully, and click Start Assignment only when you’re ready for the countdown to begin.

1. The first time you do this, you will need to sync your GitHub account with Gradescope, and GRANT permission to our GitHub organization.

1. Once you log in and link your GitHub account, you should find the repository and submit it to Gradescope.

1. Gradescope will email you a confirmation of your submitted work, with a link to the submission.

Note: If you make any future commits to this repository, you will need to re-submit on Gradescope.
You may resubmit as many times as you like before the deadline + grace period, but you will not be able to commit after this time!

You are all done with this Lab!
