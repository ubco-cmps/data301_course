## Lab 3 Explainer Video

Similar to last week, for each of the labs you submit, you will need to an "Explainer Video" showing highlights of your assignments.

Note that you only need to create ONE video per lab (so Lab 3A and 3B should be shown in ONE video).

### General suggestions for Explainer Videos:

**Important: If Vimeo and/or YouTube is blocked in your country and you are not able to upload your video to one of those two locations, please contact me on Ed Discussion ASAP and I will give you alternate instructions.**

- Your video should be a minimum of 5 minutes, and a maximum of 7 minutes.
- You do not need to explain every line of code! As a rough guideline, you should try to identify the **crucial or central component** of the question, and try to explain that.
- Thinking about the audience is important. Your explanation of your work would be different if you were explaining things to a peer, or someone who is not familiar with the content.
- For the Explainer videos You can assume that your audience is a relatively expert audience that is assessing your ability to explain your work.
- We will NOT be assessing "polish" so please do not waste your time doing multiple takes. I don't care if you say "umm" and "uhh" and "like" etc... just imagine you're having a conversation with me and speak however is natural to you.
- Your videos must be in English, and we will not be checking grammar, pronunciation, accents, speaking style, etc...
- Overall, do not be nervous and do not fear the Explainer videos. Only one TA and possibly the instructor will see your video and it will be private. 
- Use this opportunity to practice extremely important skill in Data Science! You will get better at it by the 5th video, I promise.
- If you really, really, really do not want to do Explainer Videos, you can instead choose to write an Explainer Essay instead. Please ask your instructor for permission before you choose this option, there are some guidelines I need to give you.

[Here is a video](https://vimeo.com/572844343) explaining this process in all the details (this is the same video as last week):

### Lab 3 specific suggestions for Explainer Video:

- You can choose to divide up the 5-7 mins as you like, but I prefer if you spend a little bit more time explaining Lab 3B than Lab3A. There are several questions where there is some option for freedom, creativity, and exploration so you can showcase your choices.

- Please do not explain the quadratic equation, how the `tree` command works, etc... Focus your explanations on your solutions and assume we know what the questions are asking.

- Have fun!
