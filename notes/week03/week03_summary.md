Week 3
=======================

Hello!

Welcome to Week 3 - this week, we will be working on Version Control with Git.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week03_task1" class="box"> Review feedback you receive on the lab, reflect on it, and make corrections to your repo if needed. The corrections are not graded, but it is worth it for you to fix any errors you have. You can get any lab TA to confirm if the solution you have is correct, or you can post on Ed Discussion. </input></label>

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week03_task4" class="box"> Watch the **[assigned videos](./videos.md)** - you should try to watch these videos by Wednesday's class at the latest!</input></label>

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week03_task2" class="box"> Attend the [Classes](classes.md) this week </input></label>

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week03_task3" class="box"> Attend the **[lab](./lab3/README.md)** this week</input></label>

```{tip}
The labs will be organized as semi-structured help sessions.
The TA will usually explain the key components of the lab for the first 15 minutes.
We will then take attendance mostly for tracking purposes, but attendance is not mandatory and you will not lose marks for not attending the lab.
If we see that you're missing labs and not performing well in the course, we may reach out to you about the missed lab attendance.
You are welcome to attend additional labs or Student Hours in the course if you need extra help.
