    "- **Harware** includes the physical components of computer\n",

    "- **Software** programs that a computer follows to perform\n",
    "functions\n",
    "    - (eg. operating system, internet browser).\n",
    "- **Memory** is a device which allows the computer to store data either temporarily (lost when computer reboots, eg.\n",
    "RAM) or permanently (data is preserved even if power is lost, eg. hard drive).\n",
    "- There are many different technologies for storing data with varying performance.\n",
