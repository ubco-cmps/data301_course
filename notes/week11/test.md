# Test 3

You will find Test 3 on PrairieLearn.

Content you should review for Test 3 includes:

- Functions in Python
- Data Wrangling with Pandas

```{important}
Remember that for every Test, there is also a Bonus Test and we will take the better of the two scores so there is no harm in doing both Tests. A Test and a Bonus Test will be on essentially the same material.
```

```{warning}
You will likely not get your Test results back before the Bonus Test, so please plan accordingly. Once the Test is over, you will however be able to see the questions you got.

## Test Rules

Read them carefully! By clicking START you are agreeing to these conditions:

- You **MUST** be physically present in class to write the Test, unless you make alternative arrangements with me at least 24 hours before on Ed Discussion.
- Sharing the Test password with others is not permitted.
- You will have 60 minutes to complete the test (unless you have an accommodation from the DRC).
- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans).
- For coding questions, please type your code directly in the editor that is provided to you (do not upload your file or screenshots).
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etc...)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-web, open-IDE (include PDE) EXCEPT websites that help you cheat such as Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload (Stack Overflow is permissible).
- The use of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance for any assessed portions of this course is not permitted.
- Copying the question text and googling IS CHEATING.
- Posting the question text and asking someone (including ChatGPT or other AI tools) to solve it for you IS CHEATING.
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating.
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Do not be anxious about the test! If you don’t do well - review the material and try again next week - we will take the better of the two marks!
- You will not be able to ask us questions during the quiz - do your best with your best interpretation.
- Do NOT share test questions with anyone until the Test window is complete - that IS CHEATING.
- Overall, do not stress! You will be fine :-)
