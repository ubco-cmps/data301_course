# Task 2. Bar Charts in Tableau.


## 2.1. Tree count 

Make a new worksheet called `B1` by going to the menu bar under "**Worksheet**" and clicking "**New Worksheet**" (Or Command+T on a Mac, Ctrl+T on Windows). 

We are going to make a bar chart for the number of trees in each neighbourhood. 

### Instructions 

1. Since we are interested in the neighbourhood, we are going to drag from the left-hand side under the heading "**Tables**" the column named `neighbourhood_name` to the "**Column**" toolbar. 
1. We are interested in the count of the trees in each neighbourhood, so I like to use the index to count the rows but you can use multiple different columns here. Drag the `tree_id` to the "**Rows**" toolbar.
1. We need to convert this variable to a "**Measure**" specifically a "**Count**". We can do this by right-clicking on it. 
1. Voila! A bar chart! 
1. Let's change the colour. Go to the mark card and select a new colour. 
1. Let' edit our y-axis label. Right-click on the axis and click "**Edit Axis...**" Under "**Axis**", you can edit your axis "**Title**".
1. You can edit the title in two ways by editing the sheet name or by editing the title. I prefer to edit the sheet name by double-clicking the sheet at the bottom. 
1. You can sort the bars by clicking the icon beside the axis title. 
1. Let's convert it to a verticle bar chart. On the toolbar right above "**Columns**" you'll see a "Swap rows and columns" icon. This transposes your graph so the x and y-axes are flipped (remember keep your text description values on the y-axis so you don't have to turn your head to read them.

## 2.2. Tree diameter 

Create a new sheet called `B2` and plot the average `diameter` of the tree trunks of each `genus_name` type.

This is very similar to how you would make a bar plot with one minor difference we no longer are using a "**Count**" "**Measure**" but instead perhaps "**Average**", "**Median**", "**Max**" or "**Min**". 

### Instructions 

1. Drag from the left-hand side under the heading "**Tables**" the column named `genus_type` to the "**Column**" toolbar. 
2. We want the mean diameter for each genus so we can drag `diameter` to the "**Rows**" toolbar.
3. This is where things differ. We right click the `diameter`  and transform the "**Measure**" to "**Average**". 
4. Instead of using a bar chart, trying a dot plot would be more ideal. We can convert it by clicking the dropdown menu under the "**Marks**" card. Selecting "**Circle**" or "**Shape**" will instantly convert it.     

_ðŸ’¡You can add your own shape icons by adding a folder to your "My Tableau Repository" folder under "Shapes"_
