# Task 4. Maps (Choropleths)

This, and creating dashboards, is where Tableau really shines!

## 4.1. Map of the trees planted 

Plot the location of the planted trees on a map of Vancouver.

### Instructions 
1. Drag `Longitude` to the "**Columns**" toolbar.
2. Drag `Latitude` to the  "**Rows**" toolbar.
3. You have essentially made your map but let's tidy it up. 
4. Decrease the size of your markers by clicking the "**Size**" icon under the "**Marks**" card. 
5. Click "**Map**" on the top toolbar and select "**Map Layers...**". This gives you the ability to customize the appearance of your map. You may want to:
    - Change the map style 
    - Add opacity to the map with "**Washout**"
    - Add different Map Layers 
6. Add a title as before and you've got a functioning map plot in <5 mins.
