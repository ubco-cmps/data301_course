    "### Why learn command line?\n",
    "The command line is the text interface to the computer.\n",
    "Understanding the command line allows you to interact with the computer in ways that you often cannot with the graphical user interface (GUI).\n",
    "The command line is commonly used for scripting and automation of tasks and when accessing remote systems.\n",
    "It will also be useful to run programs that make use of the command line (eg. github).\n",
    " \n",
    "### What is the Command Line?\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>command line </b>is the text interface to the computer that accepts commands that the computer will execute. These commands include:\n",
    "- starting programs\n",
    "- navigating directories and manipulating files \n",
    "- searching, sorting, and editing text files \n",
    "- system and environment configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use command line?\n",
    "The command line is part of the operating system (OS), which is software that manages your computer including all devices and programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common operating systems include Windows, Mac OS, and Linux/Unix.\n",
    "- Some commands will be OS specif\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why we would ever prefer command line over using the graphical user interface (GUI).\n",
    "- Certain tools may only be available to command line. \n",
    "- Sometimes command line is faster.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Windows Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line on Windows dates back to the original Microsoft operating system called DOS (Disk Operating System) in 1981.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command line interface is still part of all modern Windows operating systems and is accessible as the \"Command Prompt\".\n",

    "The command line for Mac OS uses the same commands as Linux. It can be opened using Finder then Utilities then Terminal.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If directoryC is contained in directoryP, then directoryC is a child of directoryP and directoryP is said to be the parent to directoryC.\n",
