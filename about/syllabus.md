# Syllabus

This is the official syllabus and course outline for DATA 301, COSC 301, and DATA 501.

```{warning} Please note that this syllabus is currently under active development, there may be typos or missing sections; treat this as a draft until the course starts!
```

Rather than interpreting this syllabus as a legal document that serves as a contract between the instructor and the students, I prefer to view the syllabus as a *living document*.
Dr. John Warmer describes this best [in his article, "A syllabus is not a contract"](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/syllabus-not-contract):

> ... this syllabus is not a contract, it is a living document which reflects the experiences, emotions, philosophies, and goals I bring to a particular course.

and also: 

> A syllabus as a plan is a lot like an itinerary before a trip. 
> There’s some definite highlights we need to hit, but if something that seems cool and worth doing crops up unexpectedly, we need to seize that opportunity in the moment. 
> If something really bad happens (the equivalent of a norovirus breakout on a cruise ship) we may need to abandon something previously scheduled entirely.

Interestingly, it is worth noting that a recent review of legal precedents suggests that syllabi are not considered contracts by the courts {cite}`Rumore2016`.

Having an adaptive and responsive syllabus is important to me as an instructor because it allows me to be more flexible with what/how/when you learn, and respond to your feedback in a meaningful way.
I invite you to be co-contributors to this syllabus, and use the tools provided to add your own annotations, questions, and suggestions on making this syllabus work for you.

```{important} Please note that I have your best interests in mind, and it is highly unlikely that I will ever change a syllabus in a way that negatively affects the class, or even individual students. If you believe a syllabus change is affecting you negatively, please do not hesitate to reach out to me, or [submit your feedback anonymously here](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6FhZZZAe9WoKdnv).

```{attention} 
All deadlines in this course have an automatic 48 hour grace period after the due dates listed above.
Any submissions submitted past the grace period will not be graded.
```

### Are there other requirements I need to know about to pass the course?

- All students must satisfy ALL conditions to pass the course:
    1. Pass the Lab component with a grade of at least 50%,
    1. Pass the Quiz and Exam components (together) with a grade of at least 50%,
    1. Pass the Final Project with a grade of at least 50%.

- In addition to the requirements above, graduate students (i.e. those enrolled in DATA 501) must:
    1. Earn an overall grade of 60% in the course, AND
    1. Earn at least 60% on the Final Project,

If students do not satisfy the appropriate requirements, the student will be assigned a maximum overall grade of 45 in the course.

## Why should I take this course?

You should take this course to get an introduction to a very exciting field of data analytics!
In nearly every industry, the collection, analysis, and reporting of data is taking centre stage. 
Very soon (if not already), computational literacy will be a foundational skill and this course will give you a taste of that world. 

Regardless of what your academic background is, you will find something interesting in this course. 
DATA 301 is actually a very popular course in the department, and it gives students some important skills in programming, data science, data analysis, and communicating results effectively. 
Though this is not an introductory programming course, we will make every attempt to make sure the content is accessible and interesting both to those that have prior computing experience, as well as those that don't. 
Pay close attention to the supplementary videos and articles that will be linked in the lecture notes if you need a primer on some of the concepts that we will only briefly cover.

## What should I think about if I'm considering withdrawing from the course?

First of all, I'm sorry you're having trouble and are considering withdrawing from the course!
This is no problem, and I will not be personally offended or upset you need to do this, I encourage you to do what you feel is right for you and your situation. 
Below is some information that might be helpful for you in making the decision.

```{warning} Please note that it is the student's responsibility to check the withdrawl dates as [listed in the UBC Calendar](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=14,339,1033,0).
```

| Withdrawal type                                                        | Effect on Transcript | Tuition refund                                                                                                                |

| After the 2nd withdrawal date (cannot happen without faculty approval) | W on transcript      | 0%                                                                                                                            |

There are factors other than money and your transcript to consider as well, including your mental health, graduation requirements/timelines, eligibility for student loans, bursaries, scholarships etc.
I advise you to [read the full list of considerations](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/registration/late-course-changes/) here and contact your faculty advisor if you have additional questions.

### ... but I've never been good at coding

## What type of information will I collect about you in this course?

Having taught [DSCI 541: Security, Ethics, and Security](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_541_priv-eth-sec) in the UBC Master of Data Science in the past, I am very aware of the surveillance culture that has permeated our society and heralded the [End of Privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesTWiKfpD0) as we know it.
That being said, as an instructor, I care tremendously about your learning and the course-related data that is collected about you is extremely valuable. 
Broadly speaking, this relatively new field is called **Learning Analytics**.
[Learning Analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/about/what-is-learning-analytics/) involves the collection and analysis of data about learners for the [express purpose](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-express-purpose-of) of improving their learning by optimizing teaching and learning practices. 

In this course, we will be using the following learning technologies (privacy policies linked): 

- [Canvas](https://faculty.canvas.ubc.ca/canvas-privacy/)
- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/legal/privacy)
- [Sli.do](https://www.sli.do/terms#privacy-policy)
- [Mastering Physics](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/legal-information/privacy-policy.html)
- [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/privacy)

All tools used in the course will be used in a [FIPPA-compliant](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/subject-areas/access-and-privacy-general/access-to-information/about-fippa/) manner, with your privacy top of mind. 
New tools may be added to the course as the need arises, and I will update this section with the appropriate information and make an announcement if a new tool is added midway through a course.

All of the tools above log data about your activity that can be used to improve the quality of teaching and learning.
In this course, I intend to use this information to:

- view overall class progress (in aggregate),
- track your personal progress in order to provide you with personalized feedback,
- track participation in discussion forums
- improve the course and your learning, 
- explore students actions in the course, 
- provide you feedback on your progress.

Unfortunately, at the moment it is not possible to opt-out of the data collection process, but if you like, you may opt-out of the process where *I use the data to give you personalized feedback*. 
To opt-out, please [complete this form](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4SB8DCF8fnktkLb) at any point in the course. 
You may opt-out with my full support, I respect your decision and applaud you for your netizenship!

## What should I do if I need accommodations to be successful in this course?

Accommodations are intended to remove barriers experienced by individuals with disabilities.
As a matter of principle, UBC is committed to promoting human rights, equity and diversity, and it also has a legal duty under the BC Human Rights Code to make its goods and services available in a manner that does not discriminate.
[Policy 73](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2019/02/policy73.pdf) (Accommodation for Students with Disabilities) sets out principles and processes governing the accommodation of students with disabilities.

All accommodations for this course are handled through the [Disability Resource Centre](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/disability-resources/contact-the-disability-resource-centre/) and I encourage you to contact them to book an appointment. 
For a more detailed guide, the {ref}`page_Accommodations` page has a list of steps you should take for this course. 

### What if I have to miss a deadline because of a wedding, birthday, funeral, religious holiday, or personal event ?

No problem! There's not even any need to tell me, or ask for permission to miss deadlines.
The course is designed to give you maximum flexibility: 

- Every deadline has a 48-hour grace period that is automatically applied.
- There is no late penalty if you use the grace period
- You can use the grace period an unlimited amount of time in the course (though if it happens every week and for every assignment, I might check in with you and gently encourage you not to leave things to the last minute)

If you miss a deadline by more than the grace period, the general course policy is that you will get 0 on it.
In some very exceptional (i.e. very rare) cases, I reserve the right to grant an extension.

### What if I have dependents that rely on me for care and unpredictable emergencies may arise?

Let's talk, send me a private message and we can discuss your needs.
I do not necessarily need to know all the personal details, just a high-level summary of your situation and what you think an ideal solution would be.

I'm sure we will come to some agreement, generally the earlier you let me know of any special circumstances or accommodation, the more I'll be able to do for you!

## How do I go through this course ethically and with integrity?

I want to be proud of your work in this course, and I want YOU to be proud of yourself as well!
That cannot happen if you make unethical decisions, including (but not limited) to cheating or plagiarism.
According to the scientific literature, the most common reasons students cheat are:

- Fear of failure and life consequences
- Peer pressure, including an inability to say no to help others cheat
- Perceived societal acceptance of cheating (Lance Armstrong, Barry Bonds, Enron, Wall Street & the The Big Short)
- Desire for success without the time/desire to put in the work needed
- Strict deadlines and due-dates
- Requirement from instructors to memorize facts, figures, equations, etc...
- High-stakes exams with no recompense for "having a bad day"
- Peers cheating with no consequences or penalties
- Unclear expectations on what constitutes academic dishonesty
- Inadequate support from instructor and teaching team

Though I sympathize with students and the stresses of your busy lives - in my opinion, there is no good reason to cheat.
I have tried extremely hard to make this course focused on learning rather than grading, and where grading is needed, to have policies that are as "student-friendly" as possible.
In particular, I hope (and expect) that the following features of the course should eliminate your temptation to cheat or plagiarize:

- 48 hour grace-period on all homework and lab due dates and deadlines.
- Long testing window (48 hours) so you can start the tests whenever you're comfortable.
- Weekly learning logs, homework and reading reflections to make you think about your learning ([metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/)).
- Timed tests have generous time limits (allowable time is 1.5x the estimated time).
- Each test has a "bonus test" available one week later; for each test, we will take the better score of the pair.
- No high-stakes exams (the single largest assessment item is the final exam at 20%).
- All course assessments are completely open book and open notes. 
- Plenty of TA and instructor office hours and several outside of normal business hours.
- A class guidebook that outlines exactly what you should do when to help you manage your time.
- Tonnes of supplemental materials including other instructional videos in case you want a different perspective.
- Weekly prompt to accept the integrity pledge to keep you accountable.
- A true willingness from the instructor (me) to help you learn and succeed in this course!

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the [Academic Calendar](http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0).

### My personal plea

With these features, and many other little things, I sincerely hope that you will consider completing this course with maximum integrity so that you never have to feel guilty, ashamed, or disappointed in yourself and your actions!

To make it even easier for you to decide what isn't allowed, below is a list of things that I **definitely** consider to be academic dishonesty:

- Asking others for their work in the course (whether question by question, or all at once)
- Sending others your work in the course
- Doing tests collaboratively (tests **must** be done by yourself and alone)
- Sending others your test questions and/or answers
- Sharing any course material onto Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites
- Searching for solutions to course material on Chegg, Course Hero, Slader or other similar sites
- Blindly googling the question in hopes of finding someone who had a similar question and then copying their answer
    - Note, googling to find resources to understand specific concepts or general ideas is highly encouraged!
- Having a tutor/friend/nemesis complete and submit your work for you
- Copying and pasting code, equations, text explanations, prose, etc... without attribution
- Manipulating the learning platforms we use to reverse engineer the randomization algorithms, hacking the timer functionality, or other similar technical [malfeasance](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/malfeasance).

### UBCO's statement on Academic Integrity

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.
At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.
This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.
Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.
For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

## Compassion

As I'm sure you're aware, *there is a global pandemic* happening right now and we could all use some extra compassion and humanity.
If you're going through something that is affecting you (course or otherwise), you are always welcome to come and talk to me about it. 
If I am not able to help you myself, then I can probably direct you to the right person or resource.
If you need extra help, or extra time to deal with something you're going through, just ask.
You will *never* owe me an explanation about your physical health, mental health, or those of your family members, friends, etc... I will believe you, and I will trust you.
I will not judge you, nor think any less of you.
I will do everything in my power to work out something that is both reasonable and fair. 
This, I promise!

## UBC Policies

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence.
UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community.
Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. 
UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. 
UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available [here](https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success).
