## Is this syllabus a contract? 

Rather than interpreting this syllabus as a legal document that serves as a contract between the instructor and the students, I prefer to view the syllabus as a *living document*.
Dr. John Warmer describes this best [in his article, "A syllabus is not a contract"](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/syllabus-not-contract):

> ... this syllabus is not a contract, it is a living document which reflects the experiences, emotions, philosophies, and goals I bring to a particular course.

and also: 

> A syllabus as a plan is a lot like an itinerary before a trip. 
> There’s some definite highlights we need to hit, but if something that seems cool and worth doing crops up unexpectedly, we need to seize that opportunity in the moment. 
> If something really bad happens (the equivalent of a norovirus breakout on a cruise ship) we may need to abandon something previously scheduled entirely.

Interestingly, it is worth noting that a recent review of legal precedents suggests that syllabi are not considered contracts by the courts {cite}`Rumore2016`.

Having an adaptive and responsive syllabus is important to me as an instructor because it allows me to be more flexible with what/how/when you learn, and respond to your feedback in a meaningful way.
I invite you to be co-contributors to this syllabus, and use the tools provided to add your own questions, and suggestions on making this syllabus work for you.

```{important} Please note that I have your best interests in mind, and it is highly unlikely that I will ever change a syllabus in a way that negatively affects the class, or even individual students. If you believe a syllabus change is affecting you negatively, please do not hesitate to reach out to me, or [submit your feedback anonymously here](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1SUW980Y13yaA2V).

```

## Why should I take this course?

You should take this course to get an introduction to a very exciting field of data analytics!
In nearly every industry, the collection, analysis, and reporting of data is taking centre stage. 
Very soon (if not already), computational literacy will be a foundational skill and this course will give you a taste of that world.
To show you the breadth and depth of careers available in data analytics, several recent graduates will be profiled and showcased.

Regardless of what your academic background is, you will find something interesting in this course. 
DATA 301 is a very popular course in the department, and it gives students some important skills in programming, data science, data analysis, and communicating results effectively. 
Though this is not an introductory programming course, we will make every attempt to make sure the content is accessible and interesting both to those that have prior computing experience, as well as those that don't. 
Pay close attention to the supplementary videos and articles that will be linked in the lecture notes if you need a primer on some of the concepts that we will only briefly cover.

## How will I be evaluated in this course?

The grading scheme for this course is:

| Item               | Weight       | Due date(s)                               |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Lab Assignments    | 40% (8 x 5%) | Fridays the week after they were assigned |
| Bi-weekly Tests    | 25% (5 x 5%) | Thursday 6PM to Saturday at 6 PM          |
| Project Milestones | 20% (4 x 5%) | Friday at 6PM                             |
| Final Project      | 15%          | Fridays the week after they were assigned |

There will be 5 tests in this course in an (approximately) bi-weekly schedule. For each of the tests, there will be a second test exactly one week later. The resulting grade for the test will be either the first test, or the average of the two tests (if you choose to do the two tests).

```{attention} 
All deadlines in this course have an automatic 48 hour grace period after the due dates listed above.
Any submissions submitted past the grace period will not be graded.
```

### Are there other requirements I need to know about to pass the course?

All students must satisfy ALL conditions to pass the course:
1. Pass the Lab component with a grade of at least 50%,
1. Pass the Tests with a grade of at least 50%,
1. Pass the Project with a grade of at least 50%.

If students do not satisfy the appropriate requirements, the student will be assigned a maximum overall grade of 45 in the course.

```{note} 
I reserve the right to have slightly different expectations for the lab assignments and final project depending on whether students are enrolled in DATA 301, or COSC 301.
```

## Course Learning Outcomes (AKA what will I learn in this course?)

1. Understand data representation formats and techniques and how to use them.
1. Work with large datasets and learn to manipulate them programmatically. 
1. Experience using a wide-range of data analytics tools including Excel, Python, SQL, R (tentative),
and visualization packages and software.
1. Develop a computational thinking approach to problem-solving and use programs to solve
data tasks.

```{tip}
The full course schedule is available here: {ref}`page_Course_Schedule`.
```

## What do I need to purchase for this course?

There is no requirement to purchase anything for this course.
You will need access to a computer (laptop or desktop) with an internet connection.
All of the course material, including videos, labs, and course notes will be available on this site, or on Canvas.

## How will this course be taught ?

This course will be taught as a [Blended Learning classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning) where some elements of a [flipped classroom](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BCIxikOq73Q) will be mixed with a more traditional coding classroom with live demos, clicker or poll questions, and worksheets.
Briefly, this requires students to watch videos and engage with the assigned reading prior to the classroom meeting (knowledge transfer).
During the class meeting, the instructor guides students through clicker (or poll) questions, worksheet problems, and other activities to help the students make sense of the material (sense-making).
See {numref}`masterymodel1` for a mental model of how learning works {cite}`Ambrose2010`.

```{figure} ../images/masterymodel1.png
---
width: 750px
name: masterymodel1
---
To develop mastery in a concept, students must first acquire the necessary skills, then practice integrating them, and finally know when to apply what they have learned. This figure was adapted from Figure 4.1 of the book "How Learning Works". The terms "knowledge transfer" and "sense-making" applied in this context is generally attributed to [Dr. Eric Mazur](https://mazur.harvard.edu/files/mazur/files/flip_your_course_online_07.pdf). 
```

### What does this mean in practical terms? 

{numref}`masterymodel2` shows a handy table to help guide you and organize your learning in this course: 

```{figure} ../images/masterymodel2.png

height: 500px
name: masterymodel2

This table describes how I think each course activity should be classified between knowledge transfer and sense-making.
```

### Want to know more about my teaching philosophy ?

Here are the key principles of my teaching philosophy and my values that I intend to apply in this class:

1. Student learning is vastly improved through active learning.
1. Effective teaching is inclusive teaching.
1. Learning technologies must be leveraged to scale instructor effort across multiple classes.
1. Exploring the connections between different disciplines is an extremely powerful motivator.
1. Teaching is three parts preparation, two parts classroom management, and one part execution.

## Course Communication

- For lectures, labs, tutorials, and office hours we will be principally using Zoom. If group exercises are planned, I may elect to use collaborate ultra, in which case it will be clearly stated.
- For official course communication, we will be using [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/63469) and [Ed discussion](https://us.edstem.org/dashboard).
- For unofficial chat, community building, sharing of tiktoks, cat videos, and general conversation, we will (optionally) be using a Discord server.

## What should I think about if I'm considering withdrawing from the course?

First of all, I'm sorry you're having trouble and are considering withdrawing from the course!
This is no problem, and I will not be personally offended or upset you need to do this, I encourage you to do what you feel is right for you and your situation. 
Below is some information that might be helpful for you in making the decision.

```{warning} Please note that it is the student's responsibility to check the withdrawal dates as [listed in the UBC Calendar](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?go=deadlines).

```

| Withdrawal type                   | Effect on Transcript | Tuition refund                                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Before January 22, 2020 11:59 PDT | None                 | 100% refund                                                  |
| Before March 26, 2020 11:59 PDT   | W on transcript      | [See UBCO Calendar](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/finances/tuition-and-fees/) |
| After 11:59 PDT March 26, 2020 ^  | W on transcript      | [See UBCO Calendar](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/finances/tuition-and-fees/) |

^ Note: Withdrawal after this date cannot happen without approval from the Faculty (Email: fos.students.ubco@ubc.ca).

There are factors other than money and your transcript to consider as well, including your mental health, graduation requirements/timelines, eligibility for student loans, bursaries, scholarships etc.
I advise you to [read the full list of considerations](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/registration/late-course-changes/) here and consult with an Academic Advisor or your Program Advisor if you have additional questions.

<!-- 
## How do I do well in this course? 

### ... but I've never been good at coding
-->

## What type of information will I collect about you in this course?

Having taught DATA 553: Privacy, Ethics, and Security in the UBC Master of Data Science in the past, I am very aware of the surveillance culture that has permeated our society and heralded the [End of Privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesTWiKfpD0) as we know it.
That being said, as an instructor, I care tremendously about your learning and the course-related data that is collected about you is extremely valuable. 
Broadly speaking, this relatively new field is called **Learning Analytics**.
[Learning Analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/about/what-is-learning-analytics/) involves the collection and analysis of data about learners for the [express purpose](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-express-purpose-of) of improving their learning by optimizing teaching and learning practices. 

In this course, we will be using the following learning technologies (privacy policies linked): 

- [Canvas](https://faculty.canvas.ubc.ca/canvas-privacy/)
- [Ed discussion](https://us.edstem.org/privacy)

All tools used in the course will be used in a [FIPPA-compliant](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/subject-areas/access-and-privacy-general/access-to-information/about-fippa/) manner, with your privacy top of mind. 
New tools may be added to the course as the need arises, and I will update this section with the appropriate information and make an announcement if a new tool is added midway through a course.

All of the tools above log data about your activity that can be used to improve the quality of teaching and learning.
In this course, I intend to use this information to:

- view overall class progress (in aggregate),
- track your personal progress in order to provide you with personalized feedback,
- track participation in discussion forums,
- improve the course and your learning, 
- explore students actions in the course, 
- provide you feedback on your progress.

Unfortunately, at the moment it is not possible to opt-out of the data collection process, but if you like, you may opt-out of the process where *I use the data to give you personalized feedback*. 
To opt-out, please [complete this form](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ePfpR44YrSOPpJz) at any point in the course. 
You may opt-out with my full support, I respect your decision and applaud you for your netizenship!

## What should I do if I need accommodations to be successful in this course?

Accommodations are intended to remove barriers experienced by individuals with disabilities.
As a matter of principle, UBC is committed to promoting human rights, equity and diversity, and it also has a legal duty under the BC Human Rights Code to make its goods and services available in a manner that does not discriminate.
[Policy 73](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2019/02/policy73.pdf) (Accommodation for Students with Disabilities) sets out principles and processes governing the accommodation of students with disabilities.

All accommodations for this course are handled through the [Disability Resource Centre](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/disability-resources/contact-the-disability-resource-centre/) and I encourage you to contact them to book an appointment. 
<!-- For a more detailed guide, the {ref}`page_Accommodations` page has a list of steps you should take for this course. -->

### What if I miss labs, tests, or the exam due to an illness, health, or other personal situation?

Students who, because of unforeseen events, are absent during the term and are unable to complete tests or other graded work, should normally discuss with their instructors how they can make up for missed work.
If ill health is an issue, students are encouraged to seek attention from a health professional.
Campus Health and Counselling will normally provide documentation only to students who have been seen previously at these offices for treatment or counselling specific to conditions associated with their academic difficulties. 
Students who feel that requests for consideration have not been dealt with fairly by their instructors may take their concerns first to the Head of the Department, and if not resolved, to the Office of the Dean (Email: fos.students.ubco@ubc.ca). Further information can be found at the [UBCO Calendar](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0).

```{tip}
If you miss a course component due to an illness, health, or other personal situation, please reach out to me as soon as you are comfortable, and I'll work with you to get you back on track.
```
### What if I have dependents that rely on me for care and unpredictable emergencies may arise?

Let's talk, send me a private message and we can discuss it.
I do not necessarily need to know all the personal details, just a high-level summary of your situation and what you think an ideal solution would be.

I'm sure we will come to some agreement, generally the earlier you let me know of any special circumstances or accommodation, the more I'll be able to do for you!

### What if I have to miss a deadline because of a wedding, birthday, funeral, religious holiday, or personal event ?

No problem! There's not even any need to tell me, or ask for permission to miss deadlines.
The course is designed to give you maximum flexibility: 

- Every deadline has a 48-hour grace period that is automatically applied.
- There is no late penalty if you use the grace period.
- You can use the grace period an unlimited amount of time in the course (though if it happens every week and for every assignment, I might check in with you and gently encourage you not to leave things to the last minute)

```{tip}
Remember, if you miss a Test outside of the grace period for whatever reason, you can make it up the following week in the second test!
```

If you miss a deadline by more than the grace period, the general course policy is that you will get 0 on it.
In some cases, I reserve the right to grant an extension, or provide an alternate assignment.

## Compassion

As I'm sure you're aware, *there is a global pandemic* happening right now and we could all use some extra compassion and humanity.
If you're going through something that is affecting you (course or otherwise), you are always welcome to come and talk to me about it. 
If I am not able to help you myself, then I can probably direct you to the right person or resource.
If you need extra help, or extra time to deal with something you're going through, just ask.
You will *never* owe me an explanation about your physical health, mental health, or those of your family members, friends, etc... I will believe you, and I will trust you.
I will not judge you, nor think any less of you.
I will do everything in my power to work out something that is both reasonable and fair. 
This, I promise!

## How do I go through this course ethically and with integrity?

I want to be proud of your work in this course, and I want YOU to be proud of yourself as well!
That cannot happen if you make unethical decisions, including (but not limited) to cheating or plagiarism.
According to the scientific literature, the most common reasons students cheat are:

- Fear of failure and life consequences
- Peer pressure, including an inability to say no to help others cheat
- Perceived societal acceptance of cheating (Lance Armstrong, Barry Bonds, Enron, Wall Street & the The Big Short)
- Desire for success without the time/desire to put in the work needed
- Strict deadlines and due-dates
- Requirement from instructors to memorize facts, figures, equations, etc...
- High-stakes exams with no recompense for "having a bad day"
- Peers cheating with no consequences or penalties
- Unclear expectations on what constitutes academic dishonesty
- Inadequate support from instructor and teaching team

Though I sympathize with students and the stresses of your busy lives - in my opinion, there is no good reason to cheat.
I have tried extremely hard to make this course focused on learning rather than grading, and where grading is needed, to have policies that are as student-friendly as possible.
In particular, I hope (and expect) that the following features of the course should eliminate your temptation to cheat or plagiarize:

- 48 hour grace-period on all homework and lab due dates and deadlines.
- Long testing window (48 hours) so you can start the tests whenever you're comfortable.
- Timed tests have generous time limits (allowable time is 1.25x the estimated time).
- Each test has a “second test” available one week later; if you do 2 tests, we will take the average score of the pair.
- No high-stakes exams.
- All course assessments are completely open book and open notes. 
- <!--to check --> Plenty of TA and instructor office hours and several outside of normal business hours.
- Class website and canvas schedule that outlines exactly what you should do when to help you manage your time.
- Tonnes of supplemental materials including other instructional videos in case you want a different perspective.
- Weekly prompt to accept the integrity pledge to keep you accountable.
- A true willingness from the instructor (me) to help you learn and succeed in this course!

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the [Academic Calendar](http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0).

### My personal plea

With these features, and many other little things, I sincerely hope that you will consider completing this course with maximum integrity so that you never have to feel guilty, ashamed, or disappointed in yourself and your actions!

To make it even easier for you to decide what isn't allowed, below is a list of things that I **definitely** consider to be academic dishonesty:

- Asking others for their work in the course (whether question by question, or all at once)
- Sending others your work in the course
- Doing tests collaboratively (tests **must** be done by yourself and alone unless explicitly part of the examination process)
- Sending others your test questions and/or answers
- Sharing any course material onto Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites
- Searching for solutions to course material on Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites
- Blindly googling the question in hopes of finding someone who had a similar question and then copying their answer
    - Note, googling to find resources to understand specific concepts or general ideas is highly encouraged!

### UBCO's statement on Academic Integrity

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.
At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.
This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.
Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.
For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

## UBC Policies

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence.
UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community.
Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. 
UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. 
UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available [here](https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success).

### Online learning for international students

During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations.
Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments.
This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies.
If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit [this calendar page](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,293,866,0) for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom).
Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects.
If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.

### Grading Practices   

Requirements to pass the course are listed above {ref}`grading_practices`.

Faculties, departments, and schools reserve the right to scale grades in order to maintain equity among sections and conformity to University, faculty, department, or school norms. 
Students should therefore note that an unofficial grade given by an instructor might be changed by the faculty, department, or school.
[Grades](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,41,90,1014) are not official until they appear on a student's academic record.
If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.
