The grading scheme for this course is:

| Item          | Weight                       | Due date(s)                  |
|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Learning Logs | 10% (10 x 1%)                | Sundays at 6 PM              |
| Labs          | 30% (10 x 3%)                | Saturdays at 6 PM            |
| Project       | 25% (2% / 5% / 5% / 5% / 8%) | Variable                     |
| Tests         | 20% (4 x 5%)                 | Thursdays during class       |
| Final Exam    | 15%                          | TBD (during the exam period) |

There will be 4 tests in this course in an (approximately) bi-weekly schedule.
For each of the tests, there will be a bonus test one week later and the better score of the Test-Bonus Test pair will be taken.

```{attention} 
All deadlines (except the Tests) in this course have an automatic 48 hour grace period after the due dates listed above.
Any submissions submitted past the grace period will not be graded (with some exceptions).
```

```{note}
Important: The maximum mark you can get on each item is 100%. Bonus marks are not transferable to other labs.
```

### Lab Attendance

Though we will not be taking attendance in labs, please note that your scheduled weekly lab session is your best opportunity to get 1 on 1 help with a teaching assistant (TA), and to work with your fellow classmates.
It is very important for you to be disciplined and establish good habits and attend your lab, even if you feel the content is too easy and you don't need extra help.
In many cases, you may even be able to complete and submit the lab during the assigned lab time. 
Building a good support network and establishing community is very important in university, so I highly encourage you to come to the lab, work hard, and be social too!
Some of my best friends today are my lab mates from many years ago when I finished my undergrad!

```{attention}
Your first opportunity to get help is the lab that you are registered in. Space- and time-permitting, you are also welcome to drop-in on other scheduled labs for additional help, but please note that students who are registered in the lab will get first priority with the TA. You can find the {{ LAB_SCHEDULE_HERE }}.
```

### Specifications-Grading

Many of you are familiar with the "Traditional Grading" model many courses use.
Briefly, this model involves earning (or losing) points on individual assessments throughout the course, and then a grade calculated by doing a "weighted-average" throughout the term.

You may be surprised to learn that this is not the only way classes can be structured, and there are alternative models that research has shown to be far better for learning, motivation, attitudes, and long-term benefit.
If you're interested in learning more details about the last sentence (and if it surprises you), I encourage you to [check out this very accessible paper](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.cbe-14-03-0054) from Drs. {cite:t}`Schinske:2014`.

I am not quite ready to fully move away from Traditional Grading yet (mostly because of a lack of resources, otherwise I'm totally all-in!) but I'd like to experiment with a modified version of Specifications-Grading this term.
Here are some [key features](https://twitter.com/siwelwerd/status/1472940473924960261) of Specifications Grading:

- Each assignment is accompanied with a clear list of "specifications" of what constitutes acceptable work at each level.
- Assignments are marked based on whether students have met each of the specifications for that assignment.
- Students are given opportunities to revise their work to demonstrate their learning.

````{attention}
For **only the Labs**, {numref}`specifications_rubric` shows a handy guide to help you understand this grading system: 

```{figure} ../images/specifications_rubric.pdf

This table describes how I think each course activity should be classified between knowledge transfer and sense-making.
```
I prefer **not** to associate percentages or grades to the levels (I personally feel that this hampers your learning and poisons motivation and creativity), but I know that it will take us some time to eliminate grades completely.
If you must think of things in terms of numbers and percentages, you can expand the box below to see my best guess of what each level translates into.

```{admonition} Resist the temptation to click this button!
:class: dropdown
Some hidden toggle content!

- The **E** level is about 100%.
- The **G** level is about 85%.
- The **R** level is < 50%.
- The **I** level does not have a number associated because it was not graded.
```

#### Resubmission Policy

````{attention}
For **only the Labs** this term, you will be able to resubmit as many times as you like after you receive feedback, **provided that you did not receive an Incomplete (or I) on your first submission**.

```{caution}
If you think your work is not of high enough quality to earn a level past **I**, you should submit a [deadline extension request](real_world_deadline_policy) instead - be sure to justify how the extra time will be used to improve your submission!
```
````

Before you resubmit, you will first need to reflect on your initial submission, and explain how you corrected your work after receiving feedback from the TAs.
Your resubmission request can be submitted on {{ FORUM_LINK }}.

There is no limit to the number of resubmissions you are allowed to use for each assignment, but we reserve the right to decline your resubmission if your reflection is not up to our specifications.

```{note}
Note: The last day to submit resubmissions is the last day of the course. No exceptions!
``` 

(real_world_deadline_policy)=
### A "real-world" policy on deadlines

There is a delicate balance between an instructor being flexible with deadlines, and giving students (particularly in introductory courses) too much freedom, to the detriment of your learning and your work habits.
It is important to build a rhythm as you go through undergraduate courses (particularly mine) and to do that, there is a fixed schedule that must be followed. 
Of course, deviation from the ideal schedule happens frequently in a term when students are taking other courses as well. 
I have built in some "pressure releases" in this course so you have another way to manage the workload of the term, especially with your other courses.
However, sometimes this still isn't enough.

In this course, we will experiment with a "real-world" policy on deadlines.
In the real world (i.e. once you graduate), deadlines and target dates still exist but they are not as rigid as they are in university.
Deadlines exist to provide us with some extrinsic motivation to complete tasks and progress through life.
If deadlines didn't exist, it would be very difficult for us to prioritize all the different tasks we need to complete - it would be total chaos!
Humans procrastinate naturally to cope with [challenging emotions and negative moods induced by boredom, anxiety, insecurity, resentment, self-doubt, perfectionism, etc](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html)...
In fact, procrastination is a form of stress relief and our brain's way of protecting us from burnout and mental exhaustion.

Research has shown that deadline extensions can lead to **higher quality work** when requested **in moderation**, and when they are **truly needed** {cite:p}`Whillans:2022`.
I want you to put in your best effort and produce high quality work and if I want that, I've decided I *cannot* have rigid deadlines - sometimes life just happens and is more important than whatever lab you're doing that week in {{ COURSE_CODE }}. 
It is also clear that removing deadlines entirely is not an effective solution (for a fun story, ask me what happened when I tried to do this in a class!).
So what do we do?

````{attention} 
**For only the Labs**, students can (privately) request a deadline extension beyond the {{ GRACE_PERIOD }} no-penalty grace period via {{ FORUM_LINK }}. 
You will be required to provide a detailed description **of your plan** to complete the lab assignment with the new requested deadline, and **how the additional time will result in a higher-quality product** than what you can submit by the deadline.

```{note}
Note: Assignments deadline extensions cannot be granted beyond the last day of classes. This is non-negotiable!
```

In general, reasonable deadline extension requests will *usually* be granted, and you **do not** need to provide a reason or excuse for *why* you need the extension. There will be no late marks taken off for submissions that have approved extension requests.
That being said, I suggest not relying on this too much because it will set you back and if you fall too far behind, there's a danger of running out of time to catch up.
````

```{tip}
I first heard of this idea from [Drs. Robert Talbert, Spencer Bagley, and David Clark](https://rtalbert.org/a-real-world-approach-to-deadlines/) and would like to credit them for this implementation. Have a read through that blog post, it's really very illuminating!
