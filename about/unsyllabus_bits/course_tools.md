```{warning}
I will be the first to acknowledge that my courses are usually heavily reliant on learning technologies.
I strongly believe that learning technologies are essential (for me) to give you my students a good experience in the course.
Many times during the course you may be frustrated why we need to use so many different tools, and why there isn't one tool that does everything.
Believe me, this frustrates me too (particularly because each of your instructors will be using different tools depending on their needs), and is something that I'm working on improving.
At the moment, the reality is that many learning technologies often only do *one thing* very well.
This of course means that other functionalities take a back-seat and exist merely to check a box on their marketing website (just to say they have the feature).

**In all of my courses, before selecting a learning technology, I do a very careful scan of the landscape, weigh the pros and cons, consider the privacy and convenience aspects, and then select the ones that I believe will best support my teaching goals at minimal inconvenience to students.**

I hope you will be patient with all the tools used in this course, I hope I can demonstrate value to you by using them in our course.
If you have any feedback about my usage of the tools, I'd be happy to [get your (anonymous) feedback](page_feedback) and though it may not always be possible to make changes mid-semester, I will certainly keep your feedback in mind as I plan the next iteration of this course.
```

There is no cost to the student for any of the tools used in this course.

### Required Tools

In this course, we will be using the following required learning technologies (privacy policies linked): 

- [Canvas](https://faculty.canvas.ubc.ca/canvas-privacy/)
- [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/privacy)
<!-- - [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/privacy) -->
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)
- [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com/legal/privacy)
<!-- - [Sli.do](https://www.slido.com/terms?experience_id=1&utm_campaign=_eid-007-control&utm_source=www.slido.com-_ab#privacy-policy) -->

All tools used in the course will be used in a [FIPPA-compliant](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/subject-areas/access-and-privacy-general/access-to-information/about-fippa/) manner, with your privacy top of mind. 
New tools may be added to the course as the need arises, and I will update this section with the appropriate information and make an announcement if a new tool is added midway through a course.

```{warning}
Even though the tools above are required for this course, if you have a moral or legal objection to my use of these tools, please do reach out to me and we can likely find an acceptable accommodation.
```

<!-- 
### Link your Canvas account to Gradescope [Required]

On the left sidebar in Canvas, click on Gradescope.


<img src="../images/GradescopeAccount.gif" width="40%">

You should then be guided through a series of steps to create an account, set a password, and link it to our course. 

This is **very** important for you to do as it'll be our primary mechanism for delivering you feedback in this course. 
-->


### Sign up for a (free) Ed Discussion account [Required]

In this course, we will be using {{ FORUM_LINK }} for class discussions.
The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself.
Please do NOT email questions to the instructor and TAs unless it is a legitimate emergency (or if you cannot access Ed Discussion).

```{warning}
The Ed Discussion tool is stored on servers outside Canada. When you access this site by clicking on the link through Canvas, you are being transferred to these servers. In order to protect your identity, UBC obfuscates your user ID before it is sent to the site. However, Ed Discussion does require you to create an account on their servers. While Ed Discussion adheres to strict U.S. privacy regulations (FERPA), UBC cannot guarantee security of your private details on servers outside of Canada. Please exercise caution whenever using personal information. You may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy if you have concerns.
```

Sign up for {{ FORUM_LINK }} using our unique course link.

### Sign up for a (free) GitHub.com account [Required]

GitHub is the world's largest, and most popular cloud-based service that allows programmers to host and share code in any language.
In this course, we will be using GitHub to release your labs and you will be using your GitHub.com accounts to edit and submit your labs.

```{warning}
GitHub is a cloud-based tool where your personal data is stored on servers outside Canada. When you create an account on GitHub, you are being transferred to these servers. While GitHub adheres to strict U.S. privacy regulations (FERPA), UBC cannot guarantee security of your private details on servers outside of Canada. If you are not comfortable with your personal data residing on servers outside Canada, to protect your identity, UBC suggests creating a pseudonym to protect your privacy. With this, and any other cloud-based tools/services, please exercise caution whenever sharing your personal information.
```

### Sign up for a Hypothesis Account (Optional)

There's a really awesome tool called [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) - when enabled, it allows anyone to highlight and comment on any website.
I have turned this feature on for our unsyllabus because I want to know what you think of the unsyllabus in our course!
Yes, it's *our* course, we're in this together and there are some opportunities for you to determine how we do things in this course.
I want your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on how you want the course to go this term.
Similarly, if you have any questions about any part of the unsyllabus, the best place to ask it is right in the document itself.
If you have a good idea for a change to the unsyllabus - I'd love to hear them, and even adopt them if they fit within the goals of the course.
I strongly believe that you are now in charge of your own education, and I am just a guide to help point you in the right direction!

Here's an animated gif of how to annotate (you'll need to sign up for a free account):

```{figure} ../images/hypothesis.gif

Gif showing you how to annotate using hypothesis.
```

This is an experiment, and I encourage you to make comments and highlights on our unsyllabus.
Let's see how it goes!
Remember that your classmates will be able to see your comments too, so feel free to interact with them on here as well - we're in this together.
Don't be shy, but please also be respectful and courteous.

```{warning}
The Hypothes.is web annotation tool stores data that it collects on servers outside Canada. When you access or use this site through Canvas, you are being transferred to these servers. However, none of your course work information is shared with Hypothes.is. Though Hypothes.is requires you to create an account on their servers, but it is **not** necessary for you to use your real name or email address because UBC cannot guarantee security of your private details on servers outside of Canada. You may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy if you have concerns. Please exercise caution whenever giving away your personal information.

### Download the Sli.do app (Optional)

During classes I will periodically ask questions to students and we will be using [Sli.do](https://sli.do) as our audience response system.
This interface for Sli.do is very intuitive and it does not require creation of an account.
You can use Slido on any browser including a laptop, tablet, or mobile device.
Below is a demo of what you can expect the Slido experience to be like (video credit to [Sli.do](https://www.slido.com/_next/static/media/aedeb61313e69817.mp4)):

<img src="../images/slido.gif">

```{tip}
It is your choice how you want to interact with the tool, but you can [download the iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/slido-q-a-and-polling/id954596240) or [download the Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slido.app).

### What type of information will I collect about you in this course?

Having taught [DSCI 541: Privacy, Ethics, and Security](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_541_priv-eth-sec) in the UBC Master of Data Science in the past, I am very aware of the surveillance culture that has permeated our society and heralded the [End of Privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesTWiKfpD0) as we know it.
That being said, as an instructor, I care tremendously about your learning and the course-related data that is collected about you is extremely valuable. 
Broadly speaking, this relatively new field is called **Learning Analytics**.
[Learning Analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/about/what-is-learning-analytics/) involves the collection and analysis of data about learners for the [express purpose](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-express-purpose-of) of improving their learning by optimizing teaching and learning practices.

All of the tools above log data about your activity that can be used to improve the quality of teaching and learning.
In this course, I intend to use this information to:

- view overall class progress (in aggregate),
- track your personal progress in order to provide you with personalized feedback,
- track participation in discussion forums
- improve the course and your learning, 
- explore students actions in the course, 
- provide you feedback on your progress.

Unfortunately, at the moment it is not possible to opt-out of the data collection process, but if you like, you may opt-out of the process where *I use the data to give you personalized feedback*. 
To opt-out, please {{ ANALYTICS_OPTOUT }} at any point in the course. 
You may opt-out with my full support, I respect your decision and applaud you for your netizenship!
