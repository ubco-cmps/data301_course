# Before term starts

Welcome to {{ COURSE_CODE }}, {{ TITLE }} !
I am very excited that you've decided to enrol in my class.
Whether it's your choice to take this course, or if your were forced into it by your program/degree is not really that important - you're here now, and you're welcomed!
Since this is an upper-level course, there are higher expectations of you self-directing a lot of your own learning.
There will be plenty of opportunities to work together in teams, explore things that are beyond the scope of the course, and do some really cool work.
Everyone should try and make the effort to make some new friends, study partners, and acquaintances.
We're emerging from a lockdowns and online learning, so don't think you're the only one whose social skills have severely deteriorated over the past few years!
Take the time to introduce yourselves, share your favourite places to go, hangout, eat, socialize etc.
Have fun with it, this is your new community!

I know that for some of you, the days before the term starts is filled with a nervous and anxious excitement, usually the good kind, but often the bad kind too.
I remember when I was a student, I would frantically check to see if course information was updated and whether there was a course website, what the class was going to be like, and if there was anything I could do to get ready for the start of class.
So when I became an instructor, I tried to reach out to my students a week or two before the term started to introduce myself and give them a few tasks to do to prepare for my class and the new school term.

```{note}
Having some stuff to do before the term starts works for some students, but for others it really feels like I'm interrupting the last days of your summer vacations. Feel free to ignore this and come back to it whenever you're ready after the term has started! You won't be missing much and it really won't take that long to do.
```

Here is a list of things you can do (but don't have to) before the term starts:

```{dropdown} 📧 1. Sign up for a UBC Student Email address!

    :color: success
    :name: print

UBCO has a super sweet printing process that is fast and convenient!
You can print from anywhere on campus and then go to your closest printer to pick up your documents.
I encourage you to set it up and try it once before things get crazy and you need to print things in a panic.
You'll never know when you need it!

```{dropdown} 🖊 3. Create a Hypothesis account (Optional)
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: success
    :name: hypothesis

There's a really awesome tool called [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) - when enabled, it allows anyone to highlight and comment on any website.
I have turned this feature on for our unsyllabus because I want to know what you think of the unsyllabus in our course!
Yes, it's *our* course, we're in this together and there are some opportunities for you to determine how we do things in this course.
I want your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on how you want the course to go this term.
Similarly, if you have any questions about any part of the unsyllabus, the best place to ask it is right in the document itself.
If you have a good idea for a change to the unsyllabus - I'd love to hear them, and even adopt them if they fit within the goals of the course.
I strongly believe that you are now in charge of your own education, and I am just a guide to help point you in the right direction!

Here's an animated gif of how to annotate (you'll need to sign up for a free account):

<img src="../images/hypothesis_annotation.gif" width="100%">

This is an experiment, and I encourage you to make comments and highlights on our unsyllabus.
Let's see how it goes!
Remember that your classmates will be able to see your comments too, so feel free to interact with them on here as well - we're in this together.
Don't be shy, but please also be respectful and courteous.
```
