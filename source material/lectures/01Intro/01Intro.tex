%\item  an average grade of at least 50\% on the exams (midterms and final) to pass the course. 
%\end{itemize}
%\textcolor{red}{Otherwise, they will receive a maximum overall grade of 45.}
%\medskip
%\item For example if you receive a 34\% on midterm 1, a 70\% on midterm 2 and a 40\% on the final, you average grade would be calculated as (34+70+40)/3 = 48\%.  Since this is below 50\% you would fail the course.
%\medskip
%%\item As another example, if you fail both midterms with a 45\%, an exam mark of 60\% would give you an average test grade of (45+45+60)/3 =50\%.  In this case, your grade would be calculated according to the table given on the previous slide. 
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Grad students Final Project}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no clicker, lab or assignment component for students enrolled in Data 501 (although it is recommended that you work through these assignments for practice).
\medskip
\item Graduate students enrolled in DATA 501 will be expected to complete a Final Project 
\medskip
\item This includes a hand-in written proposal, final paper, and in-class presentation (final week of class)
\medskip
\item Pay attention on Canvas for postings on checkpoint deadlines, rubrics, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Academic Dishonesty}
Cheating in all its forms is strictly prohibited and will be taken very seriously by the instructor. \medskip
  \begin{block}{Assignments}
You are expect to  submit original work done by you and acknowledge all sources of information or ideas while attributing them to others as required.
 \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Exams}
All exams are closed book, so no course materials should be present.
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Academic Misconduct}
Students are responsible for informing themselves of the guidelines of acceptable and unacceptable conduct for graded assignments established by their instructors for specific courses, and of the examples of academic misconduct set out \href{http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959}{here}.   Some main concerns include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Plagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs when an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own. 
\item Submitting the same, or substantially the same, essay, presentation, or assignment more than once (whether the earlier submission was at this or another institution) unless prior approval has been obtained from the instructor(s) to whom the assignment is to be submitted.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Disciplinary Measures}
 Academic misconduct that is subject to \href{http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,960}{disciplinary measures} \\
 \medskip
 Academic misconduct often results in a one-year suspension from the University and a notation of academic discipline on the student's record. However, disciplinary measures which may be imposed, singly or in combination, for academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item a failing grade or mark of zero on the assignment or in the course in which the academic misconduct occurred
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Note that all incidents of suspected academic misconduct must be reported to the Dean's Office.
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Academic Dishonesty}
\begin{alertblock}{Don't cheat!}
Do not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. 
\end{alertblock}
\begin{itemize}
%\item Incidences of plagiarism or cheating usually result in a failing grade or mark of zero on the assignment or in the course.
\item Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct)  may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
\medskip
\item Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. {\bf If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor. }
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{How to Pass This Course}
The most important things to do to pass this course:\medskip
  \begin{alertblock}{Attend class and labs}<2->
  \vspace{-2mm}
    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Read notes before class as preparation and try the questions.
\item<3-> Follow along and annotate the lecture notes in class.
    \item<4-> Participate in class exercises and questions.
%  \end{alertblock}
%
%  \begin{alertblock}{Attend the labs and do all lab assignments}
%    \begin{itemize}
\item<5-> Labs are for marks and are practice to learn the material for the exams.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{alertblock}
\uncover<6->{To get an ``A" in this course do all the above plus:}
  \begin{alertblock}{Practice on your own. Practice makes perfect.}<7->
\uncover<8->{Do more questions than in the labs.  Try the techniques on your own data sets.}
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Disclaimer}
 There is a wide variety in previous experience.
\begin{itemize}
\item Some material you may already know.  Help others!!
\item Build up your computer experience in labs and outside of class.
\item Third-year standing means that you know how to ``figure things out.''
\medskip
\end{itemize}
 The course will be very straightforward: 
              Do the work and practice the techniques to do well.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Systems and Tools}
All required software is available on the lab computers in SCI 234.\medskip
If you have your own personal laptop, it is advised that you download the required software prior to class so that you can follow along with examples in lecture.
\begin{itemize}
\item Our first unit uses Excel.  A student download of Microsoft office is available \href{https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads}{here} \\[1em]\medskip
\end{itemize}

Canvas will be used for accessing lectures, submitting assignments, posting marks, discussions, and more,\dots \medskip

\begin{itemize}
%\item This is a new(ish) system to UBC \medskip
\item Support for students is available \href{https://canvas.ok.ubc.ca/2018/04/30/support-for-students/}{here}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{The In-Class Quizzes}
\begin{itemize}
\item To encourage attendance and effort, 5\% of your overall grade is allocated to answering in-class clicker questions.
\medskip
\item These questions are answered electronically using a clicker.
\medskip
\item The clicker can be purchased at the bookstore.
\medskip
\item Please refer to the {\bf ClickerOrientation} file uploaded to the {\bf Supplementary Material} Canvas on how to use them.
\medskip
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Clickers}
\begin{itemize}
\item The clicker is personalized to you with your student number.
\medskip
\item At different times during all the lectures, questions reviewing material will be asked.  Responses are given using clickers.
\medskip
\item You must answer 80\% of the questions correctly to get the full 5\%.
%There will be at least 75 questions throughout the semester. 
 %Each question is worth 1 mark, and you need at least 30 right answers to get the full 5\%.  
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  There will be more than 30 questions throughout the semester so do not worry if you %must miss a class or two or 
% forget your clicker one day!
% \end{itemize}
\medskip
\item There are some (not-for-grading) example clicker questions at the end of the lecture (I will take them up next class to ensure everyone has a chance to obtain a clicker first)

  \begin{frame}{Data Analytics vs Data Analytics}
  \begin{block}{Data analysis}
  \emph{Data analysis} is the processing of data to yield useful insights or knowledge.
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Data Analytics}
    \emph{Data Analytics} is the science of examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about that information.\medskip
\end{block}


\end{frame}



% Differences Between Data Analytics vs Data Analysis
%Data analysis is a procedure of investigating, cleaning, transforming, and training of the data with the aim of finding some useful information, recommend conclusions and helps in decision-making. Data analysis tools are Open Refine, Tableau public, KNIME, Google Fusion Tables, Node XL and many more. Analytics is utilizing data, machine learning, statistical analysis and computer-based models to get better insight and make better decisions from the data. Analytics is defined as “a process of transforming data into actions through analysis and insight in the context of organisational decision making and problem-solving.” Analytics is supported by many tools such as Microsoft Excel, SAS, R, Python(libraries), tableau public, Apache Spark, and excel.

  \begin{frame}{Data Analytics vs Data Analytics}
  The distinction between data analysis and analytics is blurry to say the least (even \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics\#Analytics_vs._analysis}{Wikipedia} is confused).
  \vfill
  \href{https://www.getsmarter.com/blog/career-advice/difference-data-analytics-data-analysis/}{One source} might say that data analysis is a subcomponent of data analytics, while  \href{https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Analytics-and-analysis-data-analytics}{another source} says data analytics is a subcomponent of data analysis.
  \vfill
  I like to think of data analysis as the \textit{method} (ie \textit{action}) whereas data analytics are \textit{tools} used to do so.
  \vfill
  Analytics is supported by many tools such as Microsoft Excel,  SQL, Python, R, %Tableau
  all of which we will talk about in this course.

\begin{frame}{Why is Data Analytics important?}
\emph{Data analytics} is important as society is collecting more and larger data sets all the time:\medskip
\begin{description}
\item[Web] All web pages visited and links clicked, searches made, images and posts\medskip
\item[Business] Items purchased by date, supply chain/customers, industrial sensors\medskip
\item [Science] Massive data sets (biological/genomic, astronomy, physics, healthcare)\medskip
\item [Environmental] Sensors and monitors (temperature, etc.) 
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why is Data Analytics important?}
Transforming this raw data into useful insights has major value:\medskip
\begin{description}
\item [Web] Online advertising driven by understanding customer behaviour; \href{https://microarts.com/insights/why-googles-search-results-vary-from-person-to-person/}{tailored google searches}, \href{https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0\#/provision}{Google Analytics} \medskip
%When it comes to web analytics tools, Google Analytics is the gold standard. It’s simple to set up, customizable, and provides all the basic information you could want about your site. With Google Analytics, you can collect data on your audience (such as age, location, and devices), and observe how visitors find, interact with, and leave your site.

\item [Business] \href{https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/how-sales-teams-are-using-predictive-analytics}{Sales predictions}, marketing promotions, manufacturing improvement\medskip
\item [Science] Scientific discoveries, new medical treatments and drugs; see some \href{https://www.datapine.com/blog/big-data-examples-in-healthcare/}{examples} in healthcare. \medskip
\item [Environmental] Understanding of environmental processes to allow for changing policies and behaviours, eg \href{https://www.the-iea.org/what-we-do/}{Institute of Environmental Analytics} \medskip
